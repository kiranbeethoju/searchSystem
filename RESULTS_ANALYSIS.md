| BioBERT | Bi-Encoder | Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction | 0.9929 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 2.97s |
| ClinicalBERT | Bi-Encoder | Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction | 0.9875 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 3.75s |
| PubMedBERT | Bi-Encoder | Heart Failure with reduced ejection fraction | 0.9477 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 3.96s |

**Analysis**: Excellent performance across all models. All correctly identified "reduced ejection fraction" as equivalent to "low ejection fraction."

### 4. HAP Query: "Hospital acquired lung infection"

**Challenge**: Match colloquial term to medical terminology

| Model | Approach | Top Result | Score | Expected Found | Time |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|----------------|------|
| **PubMedBERT + CrossEncoder** | **Hybrid** | **Hospital-acquired pneumonia** | **1.4264** | **✅ Yes** | **7.81s** |
| ClinicalBERT | Bi-Encoder | Hospital-acquired pneumonia | 0.9656 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 3.33s |
| BioBERT | Bi-Encoder | Hospital-acquired pneumonia | 0.9409 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 2.59s |
| PubMedBERT | Bi-Encoder | Hospital-acquired pneumonia | 0.8598 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 3.71s |

**Analysis**: All models successfully mapped "lung infection" to "pneumonia" in hospital setting.

### 5. HTN Stage 2 Query: "High blood pressure stage 2"

**Challenge**: Match common term to medical classification

| Model | Approach | Top Result | Score | Expected Found | Time |
|-------|----------|------------|-------|----------------|------|

| ClinicalBERT | Bi-Encoder | Essential Hypertension Stage 1 | 0.9239 | ✅ Yes (3rd) | 3.53s |
| BioBERT | Bi-Encoder | Hypertensive Emergency | 0.9192 | ✅ Yes (2nd) | 2.86s |
| PubMedBERT | Bi-Encoder | Essential Hypertension Stage 2 | 0.8067 | ✅ Yes (1st) | 4.02s |

**Analysis**: PubMedBERT excelled at matching "high blood pressure" to "essential hypertension."

   - **Use ClinicalBERT** with proper preprocessing
   - Implement result filtering based on medical ontologies
   - Suitable for interactive search interfaces

### Fine-tuning Recommendations

To achieve >91% accuracy as requested, consider:

1. **Domain-specific fine-tuning** on your 1,000 procedure descriptions
2. **Contrastive learning** with positive/negative pairs of similar conditions
3. **Hybrid approach** with rule-based post-processing for critical distinctions
